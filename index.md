					Starting from the 1896 Summer Olympics hosted by Greece, host countries have performed quite well. In the first 5 summer Olympics hosts have won more medals as compared to other participating countries. Like in 1904 summer Olympics USA won 230 medals which is far more than all the participating countries combined. Unlike the summer Olympics, the Winter Olympics had a quite different trend in the first years. For instance, in the first winter Olympics, France that hosted that game won only 3 medals whereas Norway won 17 in the same game. The performance of countries such as the USA and Italy were better in the winter Olympics that they hosted than in the Summer Olympics that they hosted. Although host countries performed differently over the period of time and they are not the most medal winner countries except 10 games, their medal numbers are generally more than many other participant countries. But it is also a fact that there is a big difference between the performance of the host countries and the countries that have won the most medals in the last few games. For example, while this difference is approximately 6 times in the 2016 Olympic Games, it is 2 times in the 2020 Olympic Games. </p>

							The number of medals won by Brazil has increased gradually over time. Starting with no medals in the 1990 Olympics to winning 21 medals in 2020. In the 2016 summer Olympics hosted by Brazil, they won 19 medals. Comparing Brazil's performance in host and non-host years, its performance in its host year is better than its performance in all other years except 2020. The USA always remained dominant in the summer Olympics. The number of medals varied over time. But in the games hosted by the USA, they won a huge number of medals. Like in the 1904 summer Olympics they won 76 gold medals, and in 1984 summer games won 82 gold medals. In winter games they performed not so well as compared to summer ones. United Kingdom is also performed similarly to the USA in games hosted by them. But the number of medals is less than in the USA. In the first games hosted by the UK in 1908, they won around 141 medals, after that their performance declined slightly. In the last games hosted in London in 2012 UK won 65 medals. In the summer Olympics UK at least won a single medal in every Olympic they participated in but in winter games like in 1956, 1960 they didn't win even a single medal. When her performance in the hosting years is evaluated, her performances in the 1980 summer Olympics are far better than other years, and her performances in the other two hosting games are also above average performances. China entered the games far later than other top performers. From first games in 1984, they became an athletics powerhouse. He showed his best performance in the games by winning nearly 100 medals in the 2012 Olympic games they hosted. Japan had the best performance in the recent Olympics games hosted by them. In all of the history of Japan participating in the Olympics, they won the greatest number of medals in the 2020 summer Olympics hosted by them. However, their performance in the 1998 and 1972 winter games fell short of their average performance, and they also showed an average performance in the 1964 summer Olympics they hosted.</p>

					On average, countries won more medals when they hosted the games. One of the main factors of that can be the support given by crowd the participants and advantage of playing in home grounds. As in the case of the USA, the average number of medals won by the USA as a participant is 53.1, while the number of medals won as a host nation is 85.3. In the case of the United Kingdom, we can see the large difference in the average number of medals, with the United Kingdom winning only 15.1 medals as a participant, compared to around 78.3 as a host. Similar situations exist between medals won by Japan and Brazil as host or participating countries. The difference can be seen directly in the case of Greece, as in the UK. They have only 1.3 average medals as a participant, while the average medals are 30 as hosts.</p>

						Europe performed much better at the Olympics as it was more crowded compared to Asia. They have 437 medals and England makes the biggest contribution to this. South America has the lowest medal count among the continents, winning only 36 medals, followed by Africa with 37 medals. Africa has only 37 medals, most of which were won by Kenya, Egypt and Ethiopia. These two countries have fewer participating countries than Asia and Europe. In North America, the United States alone is the top contributor with 113 medals, more than all the other countries on the continent combined. The most populated continent, Asia, ranks second with 327 medals, with China contributing the most to this success. Oceania, which has the fewest countries on the continent, has 68 medals, 46 of which were won by Australia.</p>
